I am a fourth year PhD student in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at Rutgers University, advised by Prof. Antonina Mitrofanova. I work on building machine learning models based on molecular mechanisms for novel biomarker discovery of cancer progression and treatment response. 

Before joining Rutgers, I graduated bachelors and masters in applied physics and math program. at Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology.
